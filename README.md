We propose a light 3D DNN in order to diagnose ACL tears from an MRI examination. We utilize the power of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in order to use topological analysis to identify these tears. Although prior work has seen 2D pre-trained DNNs, we propose, and will add to the close examinations of the ACL, more specifically, the fine-tuning of the model based on the importance of how the ACL functions. Our model will be able to show and explain how the locations and the functions of the ACL will determine the feasibility of predicting if an ACL tear is present. Our fine-tuning uses Optuna and Weights and Biases in order to help refine and hopefully approve upon the ROC-AUC score posted by the original authors.
